## Design Patterns

This project was built to practice with differents design patterns and write some xamples to understand better, here i try to use cases based in real life where i put some knowledge using PHP.

Each design pattern will on its own module or folder, so each folder contain different context about the better example to explain the pattern

Here to run some script only you need execute in the terminal
```bash
# execute some php script
$ php index.php
```

After update composer to you can run application
```bash
# execute composer command
$ composer dumpautoload
```
